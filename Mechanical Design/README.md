# Mechanical Design Test

## DeepRobotics J60-6 Motor Holder & Connector Assignment

In this project, we use the DeepRobotics J60-6 Motor—the same motor installed on the DeepRobotics Lite3 quadruped robot (<https://www.deeprobotics.cn/en/index/product1.html>).

The CAD file for the J60-6 Motor (J60-6.STEP) and the full Lite3 quadruped assembly (<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cf75oRrzsMb29_5ZQQ8bQV89uqFTcA53/view?usp=sharing>) are provided for your reference.

**Your task: Design a cylindrical motor holder and a cylindrical motor connector to securely mount and couple the J60-6 motor in our robot.**


## Requirements

1. Please submit a complete assembly that includes the motor, holder, connector, screws, nuts and any necessary part.

2. Our automated design pipeline will attach the holder and connector to the robot body, so both parts must have a cylindrical outer shape (refer to the picture).

3. Select appropriate screws, nuts, and other standard fasteners from McMaster-Carr (《https://www.mcmaster.com/). Download their CAD models, import them into your assembly, and position them correctly.

4. Feel free to refer to the Lite3 robot dog’s original holder and connector designs or to the example photos provided.

5. After completing your design, send me the CAD models for review, and then you will 3D print them on our lab’s Bambu 3D X1C printer for functional testing.
